# multicrypt

This is an app to encrypt files, so that multiple keys are required to decrypt them.
For example, multicrypt can encrypt a file and produce 7 keys so that the file can only be decrypted when (at least) 4 of the 7 keys are produced.
Multicrypt works recursively on directories.
The actual encryption method used is currently not secure.
